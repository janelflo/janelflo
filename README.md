-👩🏼‍💻 Hi, my name is Janel! I am passionate about user-friendly technology, and I am interested in creating great user experiences. I recently completed an 18-week front-end development course online at Promineo Tech. Although I learned a lot, there is so much more to learn! The experience taught me that I enjoy the aesthetic and usability of building products, and I plan to continue my studies in UX/UI Design. I am thankful I will have the leverage to understand product development, and I plan to continue exercising my coding skills.

- 👀 I excel at delivering exceptional client experiences, as my 10-year experience lies in customer-facing roles. I am interested in growing my career as a UX Designer. I believe my experience, empathy, and natural inclination toward creativity and research will be the perfect fit for my strengths! When I am not researching, practicing design, studying UX principles, or coding, I have a strong passion for dance music and would love to combine those passions somehow! You can find me outside of the technology space at F45, music festivals, live sporting events, the lake, and spending quality time with my loved ones! 

- 🌱 My front-end development course taught me: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, JQuery, Bootstrap, ReactJS, JSX, AWS, REST, git, GitHub, and npm. While practicing my coding skills, I am currently pursuing the Google UX Design Professional Certificate on Coursera.  

- 💞️ I have an interest in SaaS offerings. I’m looking to collaborate with developers on projects to harness my creativity and build the skills needed to become a successful UX Designer. I would also enjoy social causes, dance music, nutrition, fitness, cosmetics, and eCommerce projects.
