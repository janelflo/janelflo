- 👋 Hi, my name is Janel! I am a career-changer and currently a front-end development student at The University of New Mexico, in partnership with Promineo Tech. 
- 👀 I am interested in growing my career as an iOS developer with a focus on user interface. When I am not coding, reading, or listening to podcasts about development, I have a strong passion for dance music and would love to combine those passions in some way! Outside of development, you can find me at F45, music festivals, live sporting events, the lake, and spending quality time with my loved ones! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, HTML, CSS, JQuery, Bootstrap, AJAX, ReactJS, JSX, AWS, REST, NPM, design patterns, unit testing, and algorithms.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects where I can harness my creativity and build the skills needed to become a successful iOS developer. I would enjoy projects that involve social causes, dance music, nutrition, fitness, cosmetics, and eCommerce.
- 📫 You can find me on LinkedIn at: https://www.linkedin.com/in/janelflo/
